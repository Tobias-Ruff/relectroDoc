# Prerequisites

This document shows you how to use the R package **relectro** to analyze data from tetrode recording experiments.

The documentation contains examples that you can run on your own (linux) computer.

## R
You need to install R on your computer.
With a computer running Ubuntu, run this in the terminal

`sudo apt-get -y install r-base r-base-dev`

## Rstudio
You should download the latest version of Rstudio to run the examples. You can obtain it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/).


## relectro
You need to install the relectro package. The instructions can be found on the [online repository](https://github.com/kevin-allen/relectro). You might have to scroll down to see the instructions to install it on your computer.

## databases
To make the process as realistic as possible, two real databases are used in the examples. 

You will need 9 Gb of free space on your device to use them.

You can download the data from my [Google drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B54KF3oUGY18ODQ1bVc1MkpicG8).
The download button is usually in the top right corner.
My browser normally saves the file in the `~/Downloads` directory.

From a terminal, uncompress the document with 
`tar -xf data_relectro_doc.tar.gz`

Alternatively, right click on the compressed file, and click on `extract here`.
This creates a directory called `data_relectro_doc` containing the data.
