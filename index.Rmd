This document shows you how to use the R package **relectro** to analyze data from tetrode recording experiments.

The documentation contains examples that you can run on your own (linux) computer.

You should download the latest version of Rstudio to run the examples. You can obtain it [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download3/).
