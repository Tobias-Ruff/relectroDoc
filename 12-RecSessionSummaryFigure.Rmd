# Recording session summary figure

This page shows you how to get a summary figure for the neurons you recorded during a single recording session.
It might be interesting to get this output just after you clustered your recording session to know what cell types you have at the tip of your tetrodes.


We start with a recording session.
```{R summaryFig}
library(relectro)
## assign the name of the session to a variable called session
session="jp4311-09032016-0107"
## assign the session directory to a variable called datadir
datadir="~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/linear_track/jp4311/jp4311-09032016-0107/"
## create a RecSession object
rs<-new("RecSession",session=session,path=datadir)
rs<-loadRecSession(rs)

myList<-getRecSessionObjects(rs)
st<-myList$st
pt<-myList$pt
cg<-myList$cg
sp<-myList$sp
hd<-myList$hd
```

Now we decide on what we want to display.
Let say we want two spike-time autocorrelations, spikeOnPlot, firing rate map, spatial autocorrelation and head-direction polar plot for each neuron.
```{R summaryFig2}
ptsqr70<-setInvalidOutsideInterval(pt,s=getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,env="sqr70")[,1],
                                   e=getIntervalsEnvironment(rs,env="sqr70")[,2])

# no interval set in st, so analysis based on all recording session
st<-spikeTimeAutocorrelation(st,binSizeMs = 1,windowSizeMs = 30,probability = FALSE)
st1<-spikeTimeAutocorrelation(st,binSizeMs = 2,windowSizeMs = 400,probability = FALSE)
# ptsqr70 is limited to sqr70, so analysis limited to this
sop<-spikeOnPath(sp,st,ptsqr70)
#
sp<-firingRateMap2d(sp,st,ptsqr70)
sp<-mapSpatialAutocorrelation(sp)
#
hd<-headDirectionHisto(hd,st,ptsqr70)
```

## Split screen
We have all the data needed, now we just need to make the plots.
Since we have several plots on the same figure, we use `split.screen()` to do this. 
We will first do the analysis for one neuron to start with a simple example.
We will split the graphic device into 6 screens for our figures.

```{R summaryFig3}
# prepare a matrix that indicates how to split the screen, the values range from 0 to 1
# each line of 4 numbers is minX, maxX, minY, maxY
m<-matrix(c(c(0.00,0.33,0.50,1.00),
        c(0.33,0.66,0.50,1.00),
        c(0.66,1.00,0.50,1.00),
        c(0.00,0.33,0.00,0.50),
        c(0.33,0.66,0.00,0.50),
        c(0.66,1.00,0.00,0.50)),ncol = 4,byrow = TRUE)
print(m)
## split our screen 
split.screen(m)

## select a cluster
selCluster<-2

## select the first screen
screen(1)
## plot
plot(st@autoTimePoints,st@auto[,which(st@cellList==selCluster)],type='l',
   ylab="Spike counts",xlab="Time (ms)")
## move to next screen and plot
screen(2)
plot(st1@autoTimePoints,st1@auto[,which(st@cellList==selCluster)],type='l',
   ylab="Spike counts",xlab="Time (ms)")
screen(3)
spikeOnPathPlot(sop,clu=selCluster)
screen(4)
firingRateMapPlot(sp@maps[,,which(sp@cellList==selCluster)])
screen(5)
firingRateMapAutoPlot(sp@autos[,,which(sp@cellList==selCluster)])
screen(6)
headDirectionPolarPlot(hd@histo[,which(hd@cellList==selCluster)])
## close the screens and close the devise
close.screen(all = TRUE)
# If you want to see the figure, wait before running dev.off()
dev.off()
```

Notice that this figure is not very nice. 
This is because it is not symmetrical and different font size are used.
