# DatFiles

Electrophysiological recordings are saved in `.dat` files. 
There is one `.dat` file per trial, but a session usually contains several `.dat` files.
These files are not text files but binary files. 
To read the raw data from `.dat` files, use the DatFiles class.

## Create a Datfiles object

You can create a `DatFiles` object with the `new()` or `getRecSessionObjects()` functions. 

There is no `.dat` files in our database because it would make the size of the database too large.
In the example, you can change the path to a directory containing `.dat` files.

```{r df_create, eval=FALSE}
library(relectro)
## assign the name of the session to a variable called session
session="jp4298-18022016-0106"
datadir="~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/linear_track/jp4298/jp4298-18022016-0106"
# create a RecSession object
rs<-new("RecSession",session=session,path=datadir)
rs<-loadRecSession(rs)

# create the datFiles object
df<-new("DatFiles")
df<-datFilesSet(df,
                fileNames=paste(rs@trialNames,"dat",sep="."),
                path=rs@path,
                nChannels=rs@nChannels)

# or use the getRecSessionObjects
myList<-getRecSessionObjects(rs)
df<-myList$df
```

## DatFiles Methods
List the methods of the DatFiles class
```{R dfdMethods,eval=F}
methods(class=DatFiles)
```

There are very few methods for the DatFile class.

## Read .dat files

You read `.dat` files with the `datFilesGetChannels`. The function returns a matrix containing the data, one channel per column. Here is an example to read channel 0.

```{R dfRead, eval=F}
x<-datFilesGetChannels(df,channels=0, firstSample = 0, lastSample = rs@trialEndRes[rs@nTrials])
```

## Detect TTL pulses

Events that occurs during recording (e.g. light changing, licking events, rewards, etc.) are often logged as TTL pulses in the `.dat` files.
You can easily get the time of these events.
All you need to know is on which channels these events were recorded.
The function `detectUp` and `detectDown` are used to detect the rising and falling phase of TTL pulses.
The values that are returned by the function are in data samples and not seconds.

```{R dfTTL, eval=F}
up<-detectUps(x) ## detect rising times of ttl pulses
down<-detectDowns(x) ## detect falling time of ttl pulses
```

### Save TTL times into a file
Detecting TTL pulses from `.dat` files takes time because `.dat` files are very large. 
Therefore, it is often best to detect the TTL pulses and to save the times into a file for further analysis.
In our previous example, we could save up into a file with the session name and the extension `ttlUp`

```{R dfTTLSave,eval=F}
write.table(up,file=paste(rs@fileBase,"ttlUp",sep="."),quote = FALSE,row.names = FALSE, col.names = FALSE)
```

Then this file can later be read using `read.table`. This is much faster than reading the data from the `.dat` files one more time.
