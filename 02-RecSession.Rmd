# RecSession

A recording session consists of several electrophysiological data files recorded from one mouse on a given day.
The session directory also contains several other configuration files. 
We will use the recroding session `jp19841-10072015-0108` as an example.
On my computer, the path of this directory is
`~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/circular_arena/jp19841/jp19841-10072015-0108`

The directory of the recording session contains several files. You can list them from within R

```{R session_files}
list.files(path="~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/circular_arena/jp19841/jp19841-10072015-0108")
```

If you want to know what information these files contain, have a look at the file `~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/file_description`


One role of the RecSession object in *relectro* is to read several of these files to gather the properties of the recording.
Instead of reading all these files while programing, you just get the information from the RecSession object.

## Create a RecSession object

Let's create a RecSession object to represent our recording session.

```{r RecSession}
library(relectro)
## assign the name of the session to a variable called session
session="jp19841-10072015-0108"
## assign the session directory to a variable called datadir
datadir="~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/circular_arena/jp19841/jp19841-10072015-0108"
## create a RecSession object
rs<-new("RecSession",session=session,path=datadir)
## print the content of rs
print(rs)
```

Now we have an object called `rs` that represents our recording session.
However, most of the attributes in `rs` are not assigned.
To gather the properties of the recording session, you need to call the function `loadRecSession`.

```{R loadRecSession}
rs<-loadRecSession(rs)
```

Here, the result of the function `loadRecSession()` is assigned to `rs`.
The function `loadRecSession` returns a new RecSession object with all session properties.
If you print the new value of `rs` to the screen, you can read information regarding your recording session.

```{R print_rs}
print(rs)
```

You can now read that the sampling rate during this session was `r rs@samplingRate` Hz and that the lenght of the session was `r rs@sessionDurationSec` sec.

## Access attributes of RecSession objects

All classes in *relectro* are S4 classes. 
This means that you can access their attributes with `@`.
For example, you can get the sampling rate with `rs@samplingRate`. 
Here is how to get a list of all the attributes of an object in R.
```{R eval=FALSE}
attributes(rs)
## or
?RecSession
```
Now that you have a list of the attributes, here is how you can access them.
```{R access_attributes}
rs@animalName
rs@nChannels
```
