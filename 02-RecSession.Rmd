# RecSession

A recording session consists of several electrophysiological data files recorded from one mouse on a given day.
The session directory also contains several other configuration files. 
We will use the recroding session `jp19841-10072015-0108` as an example.
On my computer, the path of this directory is
`~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/circular_arena/jp19841/jp19841-10072015-0108`

The directory of the recording session contains several files. You can list them from within R

```{R session_files}
list.files(path="~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/circular_arena/jp19841/jp19841-10072015-0108")
```

If you want to know what information these files contain, have a look at the file `~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/file_description`


One role of the RecSession object in *relectro* is to read several of these files to gather the properties of the recording session.
Instead of reading all these files while programing, you just get the information directly from the RecSession object.

## Create a RecSession object

Let's create a RecSession object to represent our recording session.

```{r RecSession}
library(relectro)
## assign the name of the session to a variable called session
session="jp19841-10072015-0108"
## assign the session directory to a variable called datadir
datadir="~/Downloads/data_relectro_doc/circular_arena/jp19841/jp19841-10072015-0108"
## create a RecSession object
rs<-new("RecSession",session=session,path=datadir)
## print the content of rs
print(rs)
```

Now we have an object called `rs` that represents our recording session.
However, most of the attributes in `rs` are not assigned.
To gather the properties of the recording session, you need to call the function `loadRecSession`.

```{R loadRecSession}
rs<-loadRecSession(rs)
```

Here, the result of the function `loadRecSession()` is assigned to `rs`.
The function `loadRecSession` returns a new RecSession object with all session properties.
If you print the new value of `rs` to the screen, you can read information regarding your recording session.

```{R print_rs}
print(rs)
```

You can now read that the sampling rate during this session was `r rs@samplingRate` Hz and that the lenght of the session was `r rs@sessionDurationSec` sec.

One side effect of calling the function `leadRecSession` is that it will check the validity of several configuration files that are create at recording time.
If there are inconsistencies between configuration files, an error message appears and indicates what the problem is.

## Access attributes of RecSession objects

All classes in *relectro* are S4 classes. 
This means that you can access their attributes with `@`.
For example, you can get the sampling rate with `rs@samplingRate`. 
Here is how to get a list of all the attributes of an object in R.
```{R eval=FALSE}
attributes(rs)
## or
?RecSession
```
Now that you have a list of the attributes, here is how you can access them.
```{R access_attributes}
rs@animalName
rs@nChannels
```

## RecSession methods
Methods are functions that work on RecSession object. To list the methods of the RecSession class
```{R RecSession_methods}
methods(class=RecSession)
```
As indicated in the output, see `?methods` for acessing help.
For example
```{R RecSession_help}
?recordingDate
```

The methods usually have a RecSession object as first argument
``` {R RecSession_calling_method}
recordingDate(rs)
getIsClustered(rs)
containsElectrodeLocation(rs,location="ca1")
containsEnvironment(rs,environment="circ")
```
